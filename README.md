    <h2>✨ About Me</h2>
  </summary>

I'm a Software Engineering student at FAST NUCES, currently focused on frontend development.
I've studied **C++ through Data Structures and Algorithms**, and now enjoy creating aesthetic and functional web experiences with **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, **React**, and **GSAP** for animation. 

I'm deeply interested in building products that offer real service and value to people. Whether it's a hobby project or a startup idea, I love the process of turning concepts into reality with code.
